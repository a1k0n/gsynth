Stuff to do:

Core synthesizer

	- deleting modules/sbuffers probably doesn't remove all the
	  patterns.  the gui seems to be in sync though.  double check on
	  that.
	- resizing patterns in pattern.cpp won't work with existing data.
	  fix that.
	- ALSA output module
	- ESD output module
	- configure flags to select output module..?
	- change pattern saving to use a "compressed" format which should
	  also make it more robust.

Machine Builder
	- Volume/pan dialog
	
Tracker
	- adding a pattern selects that pattern but doesn't update plist
	  box (wrong selection shows up)
	- more complete track editing stuff
	- hotkeys for changing patterns
	- add tracks
	- rightclick interface for adding tracks/removing tracks
	- confirmation dialog for removing tracks and patterns
	- optimize refreshes on gui-gtk
	- selection
	- cut/copy/paste
	- hitting enter in create pattern name editbox should create the
	  pattern
	- gtk: need some way to force listboxes to show correct item when
	  patterns are selected

Sequencer
	(everything)

General GUI
	- Status bar stuff
	- Tempo control
	- Song naming
	- General modal dialog box (ok/cancel, yes/no), maybe?
	- Speed up the backbuffering crap - keep dirty rectangles or
	  something.
	- splash screen
		- started, need something to put meaningful text into it
		  though.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Stuff that's done:

Core synthesizer

	- Add/remove modules
	- Add/remove tracks (add clone function to SynthModule)
	- Connect/disconnect modules
	- figure out pattern format
	- Fill buffers
	- Make a master module built into synth library
	- check connection validity (walk dependency tree) before
	  performing connection
	- Move modules/module.h into libgsyn/module.h and set it as an
	  install target as such; this way modules can be developed outside
	  of the gsynth source tree.
	- "About" information in all modules.. module writers need credit.
	- make patterns multi-track
	- Pattern creation given an SBuffer (pattern list in each buffer)
	- make gsynth_Sequence relative to
	  a SBuffer instead of single SynthModule
	- add ability to add/remove tracks from patterns; add this ability
	  to a whole SBuffer
	- process patterns on each tick (load sequences into core)
	- play a simple loop based on the size of last-added pattern
	- Win32 master output module
	- Song saving and loading.

Machine Builder
	- make all module names unique (use #1, #2, etc)
	- shift-click/drag to connect
	- Scan modules; add to rightclick interface
	- make other right-click interfaces -
		module dialog:
			remove module (done)
			rename module (done)
			module properties (unused for now)
			about module...
	- keep interface module names in sync with buffer names in core
	- rename dialog: select all text in edit box initially
	- regenerate tracker_mlist on rename
	- connection right-click interface

Tracker
	- gui-common drawing stuff/callbacks
	- make module names show up in the module listbox same with pattern
	  names
	- module select callback
	- create patterns (create button)
	- parse moduleinfo, display patterns
	- basic track editing
	- scrolling

General GUI
	- General about box for modules
